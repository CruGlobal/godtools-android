I acknowledge that I have sinned against You by directing my own life. I thank You that You have forgiven my sin through Christ's death on the cross for me.  I now invite Christ to again take His place on the throne of my life.  Fill me with the Holy Spirit as You commanded me to be filled, and as You promised in Your Word that You would do if I asked in faith. I pray this in the name of Jesus. I now thank You for filling me with the Holy Spirit and directing my life.</text>
