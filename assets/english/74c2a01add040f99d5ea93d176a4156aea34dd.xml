He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.  These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life."  (1 John 5:11-13)</text>

You can know on the basis of His promise that Christ lives in you and that you have eternal life from the very moment you invite Him in.  He will not deceive you.</text>

The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word.  This train diagram illustrates the relationship among fact (God and His Word), faith (our trust in God and His Word), and feeling (the result of our faith and obedience).  (Read John 14:21)</text>

However, it would be useless to attempt to pull the train by the caboose.  In the same way, as Christians we do not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises of His Word.</text>
